# Garbage Classification System using CNN & LSTM

This project is a real-time garbage classification system that uses deep learning (CNN and LSTM) to detect and classify types of waste from a live video stream. The system identifies six types of garbage: **Plastic, Cardboard, Glass, Metal, Paper, and Trash**.
